<h1>Andaman and Nicobar</h1>
<h3>Beach hopping</h3>
<p>We took a ferry from the Swaraj Dweep to Shaheed Dweep where the Kalapathar Beach is located and realised that missing this place would have been such a huge mistake! This beach is stunning. We saw high and low tides on the beach and the black rocks after which this beach was named. Most stunning and gorgeous pictures of our tour were captured here. It’s the only place in Andaman to experience six shades of water altogether. It is famous for its eye-catching sunrise. It gives an opportunity to watch many shades of Red, Pink, Orange, etc in sea water due to hide and seek play between the sun and clouds. We then went to the Shaheed Dweep and went to Laxmanpur Beach to see the natural coral bridge. It has two living natural coral formations in shape of a bridge.</p>
<h3>Water Activities</h3>
<p>We visited Ross Island and explored the well maintained British set-up of pre-independence era. It was great to know how this small island played an important role in saving the main Port Blair city from the destructive Tsunami. Secondly, we went to North Bay island where we enjoyed scuba-diving, snorkelling and Coral Safari which was a great experience.</p>
