<h1>1.KERALA</h1>
<p>Northern Kerala has been off the beaten track for many visitors to Kerala, who have focused more on the central and southern parts of the state. But that may be about to change. This year, Lonely Planet has named Northern Kerala as one of Asia’s hotspots, and as a paradise for those seeking a quieter taste of Kerala. Small homestays line the palm fringed shores, with uninterrupted views out across the Arabian sea.</p>
<h3>Kannur</h3>
<p>Kannur is well connected by railway north to Goa and Mumbai, and south to Kochi and the rest of Kerala. There’s reportedly a new airport for those coming from further afield. There are also buses connecting to the rest of Kerala and nearby Karnataka state. Our recommended mode of transport in India is by train.</p>
<h3>Wayanad</h3>
<p>Little heard of – outside of India at least – Wayanad is a tranquil uphill oasis of homestays, quiet villages, scenic winding roads that take you through wild forests, and is a place where you can truly escape.</p>
