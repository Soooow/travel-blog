<h1>East and Northeast India</h1>

<h1>1.ODISHA</h1><p>Rightly called the Goa of the East, Odisha is a land like no other. Yes, we all know that nature hasn’t been kind to this eastern state but Odisha never ceased to fight back, it never lost its faith and spirit. Perhaps Lord Jagganath’s bounty blessings have given the Oriya people hope to persevere and courage to carry out their desired lifestyle. Not untouched by modernity, the state has bridged the gaps between its past and present by keeping its traditions and culture alive. From its beautiful Odissi dance to the exquisite Tala Pattachitra, from the magnificent rock-cut caves to the pristine Chandipur beach and from the holy abode of Lord Jaganath to the Nandankanan Zoo, it is unlikely to see a land that flourish so well with paradoxes.</p>
<h1>2.WEST BENGAL</h1>
<h3>KOLKATA</h3>
<p>Kolkata is India’s second-largest city and the face of West Bengal. It is an interminably progressing celebration of human existence. This dynamic 350-year-old city situated on India’s Eastern Coast is the capital of West Bengal. It flourishes as the aesthetic, social, and intellectual capital of India. Also known as the ‘City of Joy’, Kolkata is overflowing with liveliness. One can expect to be charmed by the cheap cost of things, the hand-pulled-rickshaws, wandering avenues, and a countless assortment of desserts. Some highlights of this breathtaking city are The Victoria Memorial, Howrah Bridge, Fort William, Eden Gardens, and Jorasanko Thakur Bari – the ancestral home of Nobel Laureate Rabindranath Tagore. Brimming with various exciting things to do, make sure to add this city to your bucket list! This is one of the best places to visit in West Bengal for 2 days.</p>

<h1>3.ASSAM</h1>
<h3>Guwahati</h3>
<p>Situated on the banks of the Brahmaputra river, Guwahati is among the fastest growing Indian cities. It’s a gateway to many other places in the North East as well as a brimming tourist hub. Everything from the ancient temples, the wildlife sanctuaries, the scenic beauty of the Brahmaputra, and its unique culture give this place some of the best tourist places in Assam. The city has something for everyone – families, backpackers, honeymooners, and more. This is surely the most popular Assam destinations.</p>

<h1>4.SIKKIM</h1>
<p>Sikkim has a fascinating history, and they only recently became a part of India in 1975. Their two main languages today are English and Nepali, and there is a cultural mix of Tibetan, Indian, and Nepalese influence throughout the state. It’s home to the third highest mountain in the world, Kanchenjunga, which is visible from Gangtok.

Travelers need an Inner Line/Restricted AreaPermit for Sikkim. This can be obtained either in Darjeeling (a two step-process: first you have to visit the Foreigner’s Registration Office next to the ICICI Bank, then the District Magistrate & Collector’s Office where they will stamp your passport) or at the border at Rangpo (make sure you have photo copies of your passport and passport photos).



<h1>5.MEGHALAYA</h1>
<p>>Meghalaya was one of my favorite states, and it might be yours too during this Northeast India itinerary. It’s the wettest place in India, meaning it has the most amount of rainfall. Because of this, it’s also one of the greenest and most lush places in India, with its forests and waterfalls and lakes. It’s quite easy to get around and is a great place if you’re a nature lover.</p>
<h1>NAGALAND</h1>
<h3>Kohima</h3>
<p>Kohima, Nagaland’s capital, was established below the large Angami Kohima Village by the British in the nineteenth century and has been developing and spreading rapidly over the last few years. Traditional Naga villages – including Khonoma, 20km beyond Kohima, Jakhema and Kigwema – are just a short drive away, though Kohima itself is an increasingly cosmopolitan place, with traditional markets being replaced by modern shopping centres. Elsewhere the strength of Christianity is nowhere better epitomized than in the soaring gabled rooflines, inspired by the morung of the new Catholic cathedral to the south of the city.</p>
